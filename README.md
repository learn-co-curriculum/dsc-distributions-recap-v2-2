# Statistical Distributions - Recap

## Introduction

You have now completed the second of two foundational statistics sections! In the following section you will apply this knowledge of statistical distributions to begin finding *inferential* statistics.

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in this section.

## Key Takeaways

In this section, we dug into statistical distributions.

Key takeaways include:

* There are two ways we categorize distributions: discrete and continuous
  * **Discrete** distributions have a distinct, non-infinite number of possible values. For example, the number of bedrooms in a house is discrete. We describe discrete distributions using **probability mass functions** (PMFs).
  * **Continuous** distributions have effectively an infinite number of possible values (subject to measurement and/or storage precision). For example, a person's height is continuous. We describe continuous distributions using **probability density functions** (PDFs) and **cumulative distribution functions** (CDFs).
* Highlighting some specific distributions:
  * Bernoulli Trials deal with a series of boolean events, which is a type of discrete distribution
  * The **normal** distribution is the classic "bell curve" with 68% of the probability mass within 1 SD (standard deviation) of the mean, 95% within 2 SDs, and 99.7% within 3 SDs.
    * The **standard normal** distribution is a standardized version of the normal distribution, where the mean is 0 and the SD is 1
* Insights regarding distributions:
  * The **z-score** can be used to understand how extreme a certain result is
  * **Skewness** and **kurtosis** can be used to measure how different a given distribution is from a normal distribution

  ## Appendix

  Recall that there is additional material in the Appendix for you to review if you have time. In particular:

  * The uniform distribution, which represents processes where each outcome is equally likely, like rolling dice
  * The Poisson distribution, which can be used to represent the likelihood of a given number of successes over a given time period
  * The exponential distribution, which can be used to represent the amount of time it may take before an event occurs
